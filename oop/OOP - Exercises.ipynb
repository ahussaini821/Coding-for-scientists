You could then derive two classes, say ```DNASequence``` and ```ProteinSequence```, with specific functions - for instance statistics on aminoacid/nucleotide usage, translation, etc. Your code can even transparently invoke command line utilities such as BLAST, CLUSTALW, etc using the ```subprocess``` module, see https://docs.python.org/2/library/subprocess.html#module-subprocess\n",
